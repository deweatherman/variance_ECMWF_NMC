# "MeanCovWriting" routines and parts

This repo contains code that will download 
and/or read datasets of atmospheric variables
(e.g. ERA5 data), compute and write mean
and covariance matrices for these variables
using xarray, pandas and dask. This is a work in progress 

## Purpose of the repo

Practice a bit with xarray, pandas and dask. Produce
usable mean and covariances for wind retrievals


## Documentation

Coming soon.
