# "Variances estimation using ECMWF forecasts and NMC method" 

In this repo we include two Jupyter notebooks for now:
- ***get_mars*** is an example of retrieving data from the ECMWF's MARS archive.
- ***error_cov*** is an example on how to estimate the variance of the error in the forecast model using the NMC method. 

## Purpose of the repo

Produce usable mean and covariances for wind retrievals using Jupyter Notebooks and modern tools such as:
- [xarray](https://docs.xarray.dev/en/stable/)
- [Dask](https://www.dask.org/)
- [Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/)
- [Cartopy](https://scitools.org.uk/cartopy/docs/latest/)
- Etc.

We want to propose a methodology of work were development and distribution is based on Jupyter Notebooks; this is a great environment
to develope, prototype and deploy solutions for geoscience at scale. It is also very well suited to "connect" with Machine Learning tooling,
such as [Sci-kit Learn](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/), [TensorFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org/), etc. 


## Documentation

Every Notebook in this repo is documented via Markdown.
